                <div class="about-text">
                    <h3>What is an AI Content Detector?</h3>
                    <p>AI content detector is a tool that helps you identify content created by using Artificial Intelligence from a given text. Our AI content detector is trained with tremendous data from AI engines. It uses Natural Language Processing(NLP) technology to analyze the text. Publishers, as well as others like editors, marketing managers, and examiners, can use it to verify whether the content is original or not. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Why use an AI detector?</h3>
                    <p>People searched for AI content <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ai-content-statistics/">nine times</a> more since February 2022, as AI tools became more accessible. However, the widespread use of AI content generation also raised many concerns. Thousands of tech leaders including <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/29/elon-musk-apple-steve-wozniak-over-1100-sign-open-letter-6-month-ban-creating-powerful-ai/">Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak</a> sent an open petition letter to stop AI experiments. 
                        Considering these risks, it is better to have tools that can identify AI content. Here are some reasons to choose an AI content detector.
                        </p>
                        <h4>1. Verify the authenticity</h4>
                        <p>AI-generated content often tends to be loaded with false information. Therefore, it is wise to verify the source and authenticity of the content before you trust it. Considering the early example, you can paste the article that claims shocking information to an AI detector. Share the information only if the tool confirms that it is human-generated content.</p>
                        <h4>2. Avoid plagiarism</h4>
                        <p>Keep in mind that even the most prominent AI tools are trained with data from search engines including blogs, academic papers, etc. from others. The chances of plagiarism in AI content are high. Times has even sued Open AI for generating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">New York Times</a> articles verbatim without citing. </p>
                        <h4>3. Ensure Quality</h4>
                        <p>At least for now, AI-generated content is still lagging behind human-generated content in terms of creativity, largely due to the use of repetitive words and sentences. Most AI tools generate content in an over-polite manner with hedging sentences. Such a monotony tone affects the quality as well as user engagement.</p>
                        <h4>4. Protect SEO Ranking</h4>
                        <p>Even though search engines do not strictly prohibit content, most of them have a strict stance against poor and plagiarized content. A study by <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-vs-human-content-what-actually-gets-you-results-research-report/">Marketing Insider Group</a> found that humanized content generated more web traffic and ranked more keywords as compared to AI content. By using our GPT-content detector, you can ensure that your content is ready to compete in the SEO arena.</a> articles verbatim without citing. </p>
                        <h3>How AI Content Detector Works?</h3>
                        <p>Since the concept of an AI Detector is relatively new, you might be curious about how it works. Well, it's not that complex. <br><br>
                            In fact, our AI content detector works with the same technology as that of prominent AI content marketing tools. We trained it with the same GPT model as that of any other AI content tool. Then, it uses the Natural Language Processing(NLP) technology to understand your check and cross-check it with the trained data. It's as simple as that. <br><br>
                            The text need not be an exact copy to be identified. Apart from cross-verification with models, we consider 2 main things to detect AI content: <br>
                            </p>
                            <h4>1. Variation</h4>
                            <p>AI content comparatively has a lower variation in sentence structure and length. That means, if the first sentence is between 10-20 words, it is likely to maintain that length throughout the text. On top of that, it has a tendency to use excessive connector words like 'and', 'or', etc. This makes it easy for our tool to catch the monotonous AI-generated sentences.</p>
                            <h4>2. Predictability</h4>
                            <p>Predictability means it's how easy it is to predict the next words after analyzing the first words of a sentence. AI models usually focus on generating text that is smooth to read. But, that's not the case with humans. Human texts are more creative and therefore, have lower predictability. </p>
                            <h3>AI VS Human Content: Which is better for SEO?</h3>
                        <p>Well, you might have mastered the art of AI content writing. But, here's a question for you: does Google even consider your AI content? The truth is that Google does not have an announced policy for treating AI content. However, there are some points to consider: <br> <br>
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    First of all, you must know how Google ranks content. The search engine aims to promote content with Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustability (EEAT). That means the focus is on quality rather than the source. However, AI tools are reported to provide fake or generic content that may risk your SEO efforts.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Google does have a stance against AI-generated text without any value and EEAT. Such content might be removed from the search results.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As said earlier, there are several instances when even prominent AI models are caught red-handed for providing verbatim sentences from various sources. Google does have a strict policy against plagiarism, and it punishes such content.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Imagine this. You have typed in a prompt to generate a blog on 5 Tips for SEO and posted it. Somehow you managed to rank it. But, is that the end? Several marketers will enter the same prompt. Even if we assume that it will not generate the same text, the essence will remain the same, right? Eventually, your blog will have to compete with thousands of blogs with the same content(not words). Therefore, no matter how hard you optimize an AI content, its ranking is temporary.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>How to Use the AI Content Detector Tool?</h3>
                        <p>You need not type in endless prompts and wait for the results. The process of AI content detection is quite simple and straightforward. Let's break it down: <br>
                            </p>
                            <h4>1. Paste the text</h4>
                        <p>Copy the content which you want to check and paste it into our AI content detector. The text must be less than 4,000 words for a single check. The rest of the content can be checked in the next run. Alternatively, you can also enter the URL of the content or upload it as a file. Our tool will automatically extract text from it.</p>
                        <h4>2. Hit the Button</h4>
                        <p>You don't need to type any prompt. Upon pasting the text, just click the 'Detect' button. Our tool will analyze the text and cross-check it with the models to come up with a result.</p>
                        <h4>3. View the results</h4>
                        <p>The Free AI content detector tool will generate the result report within a split second. It lets you know how much percentage of the content is likely to be AI-generated. You can even see the portions of the text that are generated through AI. Portions that are highlighted with green may be written by a human. Yellow shows that the text is likely to be generated by AI while red shows that there are high chances that it is AI-generated text.</p>
                        <h4>4. Take actions</h4>
                        <p>Take precautionary measures to avoid the consequences of AI content. You can verify the sources of portions flagged as AI-generated and if needed, remove it from the content.</p>
                        <h3>Are AI content detectors reliable?</h3>
                        <p>The best AI tools like Bard, Chat GPT, and Bing unanimously state that they may make some mistakes and are constantly improving to avoid them. The same is the case with AI content detectors. As of now, no AI content detector tool claims 100% accuracy. Both these technologies are currently in an experimental phase and require updates for more reliability. <br><br>
                            However, our AI content detector tool has taken reasonable measures to avoid any false alarms. It is trained with advanced AI language models, and patterns for the most accuracy. And that's not the end. We will be constantly updating it with the latest data and changes to improve the accuracy.
                             <br>
                            </p>
                            <h3>How to avoid AI detection?</h3>
                        <p>It's quite annoying when your content gets flagged as AI-generated even though you may not even have an account in the AI tool. Sadly it happens. So, how could you avoid such a situation? Check out some tips to avoid AI content detection: <br>
                            </p>
                            <h4>1. Refine the Sentence structure</h4>
                        <p>All AI detector tools may not be trained with machine learning models. Many of them just look for patterns like complex sentences and perfect grammar, to detect AI content, as of now. So, you rework the sentence structure to avoid AI content detection. It's a good idea to split complex sentences into two.</p>
                        <h4>2. Rephrase the words</h4>
                        <p>AI models often generate some overused words in their texts. Including such words may raise false alarms among the detectors. Some common examples of such words are: 'enhanced', 'tapestry', 'nestled', 'excitingly', 'groundbreaking', etc. Consider using synonyms for such repetitive words to avoid AI detection. </p>
                        <h4>3. Personalization</h4>
                        <p>The best way to avoid AI content detection is to add a bit of personalization to the content. For instance, adding your personal experience to the content not only makes it special but also creates a positive impression on the Google algorithm. And you know what? Readers always prefer to trust people with relevant experience.</p>
                        <h4>4. Improve connectivity</h4>
                        <p>Consider making your content more interactive to avoid AI detection. Try to ask questions to your readers. Use the language you speak. Viewers always prefer content that connects and interacts with them.</p>
                        <h4>5. Instill Creativity</h4>
                        <p>As of now, AI models are not even an opponent to human creativity. The best way to make your content stand out from AI-generated texts is to instill creativity in it. Present a unique perspective on a topic that no one has even thought of. People always tend to read something fresh and unique.  <br><br>

                            <h3>AI Content Detector VS Plagiarism Detector</h3>
                            <p>In the content marketing field, many often confuse these terms. And, some even use just one for the verification process. So, let's get it right. <br><br>
                                AI Content detectors are tools that identify text generated using Artificial Intelligence technology. Detector tools use language models and NLP for that. They also look specifically for some patterns like overused words, uniform sentence structure, etc. <br><br>
                                Plagiarism detectors are used to check whether the content is copied from another source. They do this by cross-checking the text with vast data of web pages, articles, research papers, blogs, etc. available on the internet. Plagiarism detectors don't look for any specific patterns and flag red only if they find the exact match. <br>
                                <br>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Why Use Our AI Detector?</h3>

                            <h3>Who Should Use an AI Detector?</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ai-content-statistics/">50%</a> of business leaders use AI content. That's just the case with the business sector. In fact, it's spreading everywhere from research papers to the ad copy in your newspaper. So, practically speaking, the AI detector tool is helpful for everyone. However, our tool is specifically designed for some sects who may find it the most useful. Some of them are: <br>
                            </p>
                            <h4>1. Students</h4>
                        <p>As per a survey by BestColleges, <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-students-ai-tools-survey">31%</a> of students said that their instructors or universities prohibited them from using AI tools while preparing academic papers. Even though every university may not have a strict stance against AI, all of them are against plagiarism. And AI tools are repetitively accused of plagiarism.  <br>
                            That means in any case, you must ensure that your projects and other academic papers are free from AI content. With our AI content detector tool, you can confidently submit your papers so that there's no AI-generated text.
                            </p>
                        <h4>2. Educators</h4>
                        <p>The rise of AI technology has imposed a serious risk upon the education field- integrity. And there's only one solution for that. AI detector. Verify the authenticity and originality of a paper by running it through our AI detector tool. </p>
                        <h4>3. Bloggers</h4>
                        <p>As mentioned earlier, there are high chances for Google to remove AI-generated content from the search page. Make sure that the content you create does not get punished. Use our AI detector tool to verify the quality and trustability of your blogs. </p>
                        <h4>4. AI Model Training</h4>
                        <p>Repetitive and outdated data are responsible for half the problems caused by current AI models. That's something you can avoid, too. Utilize our AI detector tool to train your AI tool just with human-written content rather than potentially fake AI texts.</p>
                        <h4>5. Publishers</h4>
                        <p>A Statista report suggests that almost <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1388542/authors-using-ai/">23%</a> of authors are using AI in their work, which may lead to many issues related to copyright, plagiarism, etc. How can you ensure the authenticity of a book before publishing it? Use our detector tool to find out whether it's AI-generated and safeguard your publishing house from legal issues.</p>

                        <p>No. AI tools are often trained with the same language models and data. That means the same text can be generated from different tools. So, it's not practically possible to detect the specific tool.</p>

                        <p>Yes, our AI detector is trained with human-written as well as AI-generated texts. So, this tool can identify any text that does not have a human touch and notifies you of any mixed content along with a percentage break-up.</p>

                        <p>It is generally recommended to aim for less than 20% AI-generated content in any given text, although ideally, the percentage should be 0. If the percentage of AI-generated content is between 20 and 50, it is likely that the text was partially or fully generated by AI. If the percentage exceeds 50%, then there is a high chance that the entire text was generated by AI. </p>
